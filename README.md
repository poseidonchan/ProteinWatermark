# ProteinWatermark: enhances biosecurity in protein design

Compared to the conventional biosecurity regulation method proposed/mentioned in the comments given by Baker and Church ([Protein design meets biosecurity](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1671), *Science*), adding watermark to the designed protein could achieve several advantages. First, the watermarked protein is not easy to be modified to escape the tracing. Second, using protein/DNA synthesizer to synthesize *de novo* proteins does not have to upload protein sequence to authority for recording thus protect the IP. Instead, with authority assigned private key and strictly controlled synthesizers, researcher is allowed to pass check with correct private key and corresponding watermarked sequences. Third, the watermarked technique can be broadly applied on autoregressive based model easily without harming the information sharing process in the community.
