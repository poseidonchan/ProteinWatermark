# ProteinWatermark: 

# Enhancing biosecurity in protein design

Compared to the conventional biosecurity regulation method proposed/mentioned in the comments given by Baker and Church ([Protein design meets biosecurity](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado1671), *Science*), adding watermark to the designed protein could achieve several advantages:
- The watermarked protein is not easy to be modified to escape the tracing thus enhancing the biosecurity and IP protection. 
- Using protein/DNA synthesizer to synthesize *de novo* proteins no longer requires researchers upload protein sequence to authority for record thus enhancing the privacy. Instead, with authority assigned private key and strictly controlled synthesizers, researcher is allowed to pass check with correct private key and corresponding watermarked sequences. 
- The watermarked technique can be broadly applied on probabilistic based generative model easily without harming the information sharing process in the community.
